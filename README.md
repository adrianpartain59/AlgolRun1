# Algol Run

> "The Demon Star watches. The moon hungers. Run."

Algol Run is an infinite runner built in Unity where survival is the only objective. Stranded on a hostile moon, you must dodge obstacles, blast through waves of alien fauna, and outrun the ancient guardian that hunts you.

## 📜 The Story

**Mission**: Deep Space Reconnaissance, Sector Perseus  
**Target**: The Algol Binary System  

Known since antiquity as the Demon Star, Algol has always been an omen of misfortune. Your crew dismissed the myths as superstition, until the navigation computer suffered a catastrophic failure.

Pulled out of warp by an unexpected gravity well, your ship was torn apart, scattering debris across the surface of a jagged, desolate moon orbiting the star. The impact was brutal. Your crew did not make it. You are the sole survivor, clawing your way out of the burning wreckage of the command module.

But you are not alone.

As the dust settles, a shadow rises from the craters. The Lunar Sentinel, the alpha predator of this rock, has found you. With your service blaster in hand and adrenaline coursing through your veins, you have only one choice: run.

## 🎮 How to Play

The goal is simple: run as far as you can.  
If you stop, you die.

## 👾 The Beasts of Algol

The moon ecosystem is hostile and evolved to kill. You will encounter three distinct threat classifications during your escape.

### 1. The Crimson Scout

**Threat Level**: Low  
**Behavior**: Fast and erratic  

The most common threat on the surface. These red skinned winged creatures hunt in packs. Individually they are weak and can be taken down with a single shot, but their speed and numbers can quickly overwhelm a distracted runner.

### 2. The Toxic Flier

**Threat Level**: Medium  
**Behavior**: Slow, ranged attacker  

A mutated variant evolved to spew corrosive acid. They are slower than the Scouts and appear less frequently, but they possess a higher health pool.

**Attack**  
Watch out for the glowing green slime balls they shoot from their mouths. Contact is fatal.

### 3. The Lunar Sentinel

**Threat Level**: EXTREME  
**Behavior**: Unstoppable pursuer  

The Apex Predator. The Sentinel chases you from the moment you crawl from the wreckage. It is made of the very moon rock you stand on, dense, ancient, and impervious to standard laser fire.

**Strategy**  
Do not engage. Your weapons will not harm it. Your only hope is to outrun it.
